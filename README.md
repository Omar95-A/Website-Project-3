# Website Project 3

> A Website Called `AK Website` Is A Platform to Sell Digital Products Online But It Is More Advanced And Bigger Than Website Project 2. I used HTML, CSS, Icon library from Font Awesome and normalize.css v8.0.1 its A modern, HTML5-ready alternative to CSS resets. Normalize.css makes browsers render all elements more consistently and in line with modern standards.

#### To be clear, the images in this website are of people that do not exist. They are not real, they are from a site that offers images of fake people AI generated. The names are also fake names.
