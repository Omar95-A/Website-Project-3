# Website-Project-3
The Website Called “AK website” Is a Platform For Selling Digital Products Online But It Is More Advanced And Bigger Than Website Project 2. I used HTML, CSS, Icon library from Font Awesome and normalize.css v8.0.1 its A modern, HTML5-ready alternative to CSS resets. Normalize.css makes browsers render all elements more consistently and in line with modern standards.
